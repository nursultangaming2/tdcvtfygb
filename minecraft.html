<p><html2> in Bedrock Edition, How to Play is a built-in guide designed to help new players to Minecraft. It tells the player how the main aspects of the game work, some controls, and some tips to get started. The guide is located in the Settings screen, accessible from the title screen or the pause menu. A list of topic links appear on the left, with content on the right. These sections are reproduced below.

At the bottom of the sections is a button leading to the Encyclopedia. The Encyclopedia describes more specific features in the game in detail. Some tabs in the Encyclopedia can be opened from "?" buttons in some GUIs, like the inventory and the cartography table.

The Encyclopedia and the How to Play guide is sometimes missing information or outdated.

The content of this article reproduces the game's How to Play guide and Encyclopedia in its entirety, with some reformatting and internal linking as needed for optimal presentation as a Wiki page.

The How to Play guide and the Encyclopedia describe some controls. The controls differ on some devices, and the contents of the guide change with it. In this article, the default controls for Keyboard & Mouse are shown.

The table of contents includes all of the topics in the game's guide, starting with "Moving around".</html2></p>

<p2><br>Many blocks, like wood, can be turned into useful items by crafting. To do this, you'll find a simple crafting grid on the right-hand side of the inventory screen.

For example, put a single wood log anywhere on the crafting grid, and several planks will appear in the output slot.

Simply, drag your shiny new planks to your hotbar. Now you're ready to place them into the world! </p2>
